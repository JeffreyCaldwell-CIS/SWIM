SWIM – Systematic Warehouse Infrastructure Monitoring

Independent Systems Engineering Project

SWIM is a backend infrastructure monitoring system designed to automate health tracking and state evaluation for small-to-medium server environments. The system applies strict threshold-based state transitions (Normal, Warning, Critical, Shutdown) to reduce ambiguity in operational status and prioritize data integrity over uptime at all costs.

The architecture emphasizes deterministic state-machine logic, clear escalation paths, and automated response workflows rather than visual dashboards. SWIM is designed to integrate with both on-premises and cloud-based environments and focuses on early detection, controlled degradation, and fail-safe shutdown behavior to prevent data corruption or loss.

Key Concepts & Technologies:

State-machine driven infrastructure monitoring

Threshold-based alerting and escalation logic

Backend decision systems without UI dependency

Linux automation and Bash scripting

.NET backend development

SQL-based persistence and logging

Secure-by-design operational assumptions

SDLC and Agile-aligned iterative development
